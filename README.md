# TeaAndPronouns
This is an app based upon a chart found in the kitchen of a warehouse in West London. The chart allows guests to specify their name, pronouns (e.g. he/she/they), their tea preferences, and their dietary requirements.

# Running from source
The app is written using react-native which can be set up on your computer by following the steps at https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html
